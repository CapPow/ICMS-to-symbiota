# ICMS to symbiota

This work is freely available for use or adaptation in hopes it can assist future data migration efforts. 

No warrenties are expressed or implied. Always work on redundant data.

This repository is an attempt to translate NPS Natural History records from ICMS structure into a Symbiota (Modified Darwin Core) appropriate format.

The scope of this work is Vascular plants, but this should be easily adaptable for other collections.
